  <h1>Retry System UberASM</h1>
  <p>The Retry System is a useful patch for both Kaizo hacks and generally hard hacks, as its primary function is to enable fast level reloading to skip going to the Overworld everytime the player dies (similarly to games like Super Meat Boy). Additionally it provides for multiple level midways, both as midway objects and automatic midways on level entrance, and many more features.</p>
  <p>This package is a spiritual successor of the <a href="https://smwc.me/s/26078">original Retry patch</a> made by <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=1250">worldpeace</a>, to expand its capabilities and to make it compatible with more resources as a consequence of it being primarily a UberASM resource.</p>

  <h3 id="config">Configuration</h3>
  <p>The Retry System can be configured in a lot of ways, from basic general settings, to level specific settings, to more nuanced options for advanced users. All the files you can edit can be found in the <code>retry_config</code> folder: it is unrecommended to edit anything in the <code>retry_config/code</code> folder (which contains all the source code) unless you know exactly what you're doing.</p>
  <p>All the configuration files include some comments on how to use them and what they can do, but you can get a more in depth (and readable) explanation for each file with the pages below.</p>

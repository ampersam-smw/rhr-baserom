The baserom's resources are all compatible with SA-1, but the baserom itself is configured to be FastROM by default. To use SA-1 it only takes a couple steps to switch over to it:

1. in the "config_baserom.txt" file in the LunarHelper folder, change the "initial_patch" setting to use the "initial_patch_sa1.bps" option.

2. Run LunarHelper.exe and rebuild your rom.

That's it!

To hide the status bar on a per-level basis, apply DisableStatus.asm to each level number that you want in the list_uberasm.txt file in the UberASM folder.

If you are using other UberASM on your level you can use the following method to hide the status bar by calling it from the library folder in your chosen asm by adding the following to your desired uberASM file:

    load:
        lda #$01
        sta $79  ; must match value in patch in Tools/Asar/RAMToggledStatusbar.asm
        rtl

"How do I remove things from the baserom?"
------------------------------------------

The Lunar Helper build system makes it easy to remove items from the baserom without a problem as it re-builds your ROM from scratch avoiding resource conflicts.

Removing resources, like blocks or sprites, is as straightforward as editing the list of the respective tool and running Lunar Helper's "(Re)Build" action. You can then delete those resources, if desired.

To remove global patches from the baserom: edit the list of patches in LunarHelper/config_patches.txt, then re-run Lunar Helper's "(Re)Build" action.

To remove specific hexedits or tweaks: edit the Tweaks.asm file, in Tools/Asar folder, then re-run Lunar Helper's "(Re)Build" action.



"How do I hide the status bar?"
-------------------------------

This baserom comes with several objects to toggle feature on/off in levels, including the Status bar. Check out the "What's What - UberASM Objects" also in the Docs folder.


"Why are my block graphics not looking right?"
----------------------------------------------

The custom block graphics in the baserom use ExGraphics, loading E17 into the FG2 slot in the graphics override dialog will make the blocks appear as they are intended to in other levels.

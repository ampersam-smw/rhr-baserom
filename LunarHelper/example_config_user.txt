-- you can set emulator_path to an emulator of your choosing that will be used

-- you can uncomment this config variable to make Lunar Helper automatically reload your emulator
-- if you have it open while a (Quick) Build finishes, which is nice if you're prototyping something
-- note that for this to work, you have to launch your emulator using Lunar Helper, it won't work

-- you can uncomment this config variable to stop Lunar Helper from warning you about arbitrary
-- dependencies after a build, arbitrary dependencies will result in your quick build taking
-- slightly longer than may be necessary, but should not cause any problems, so you can ignore
-- them if you want, though in most cases they should be easy enough to convert to dependencies
-- that Lunar Helper can understand

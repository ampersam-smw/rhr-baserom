Lunar Helper ^_^

B - (Re)Build
Creates your ROM from scratch, using your provided clean SMW ROM as a base and inserting all the configured patches, graphics, levels, etc.

Q - Quick Build
Attempts to reuse a previously built ROM for the build process if it is available. Automatically determines if a full rebuild is needed or if only certain tools need to be reapplied or resources need to be reinserted.

R - Run
Loads the previously-built ROM into the configured emulator for testing. The ROM must already be built first.

T - Test (Build -> Run)
Executes the above two commands in sequence.

E - Edit (in Lunar Magic)
Opens the previously-built ROM in Lunar Magic. The ROM must already be built first.

P - Package
Creates a BPS patch for your ROM against the configured clean SMW ROM, so that you can share it!
